= Azure Key Vault Connector 1.1 Reference - Mule 4

Anypoint Connector for Azure Key Vault (Azure Key Vault Connector) enables you to retrieve secrets, keys, or certificates, and encrypt or decrypt content.


[[Config]]
== Configuration

Default Configuration for Azure Key Vault Connector.


[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
|Name | String | Name for this configuration. Connectors reference the configuration with this name. | | x
| Connection a| <<Config_Connection, Connection>>
 | Connection types for this configuration. | | x
| Name a| String |  ID used to reference this configuration. |  | x
| Expiration Policy a| <<ExpirationPolicy>> |  Configures the minimum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration.   |  |
|===

[[Config_Connection]]
=== Connection - Connection Type

Uses a client ID, client secret, and cryptography client cache for authentication. Note that the connector configuration does not allow properties such as `client_id` and `client_secret` to be hard coded.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Name | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Client Id a| String | Client ID. |  | x
| Tenant Id a| String | Tenant ID. |  | x
| Client Secret a| String | Client secret. |  | x
| Vault Name a| String | Vault name. |  | x
| Use Azure Default Credential a| Boolean |  Uses the authentication parameters taken from environment variables. |  false | 
| Uri Override a| String |  The URI override for the key vault. If you configure this field, then the value for the Vault Name field is not considered for the connection configuration. If the key vault is not located on Azure Commercial Cloud, then configure this field. |  | 
| Cryptography Client Cache a| <<CachedCryptographyClientConfiguration>>|  The cryptography client is created based on a key. If the key does not change (no new versions are created), the client is cached and the *Encrypt Message* and *Decrypt Message* operations take less time.
When encrypting or decrypting a message, a key must be retrieved internally. Retrieving a key every time makes the operation take longer to execute. Enable *Cryptography Client Cache* to save time when retrieving the key.
|  |
| Reconnection a| <<Reconnection>> |  Configures a reconnection strategy to use when a connector operation fails to connect to an external server. |  |
| Pooling Profile a| <<PoolingProfile>> |  Characteristics of the connection pool. |  |
|===

[[CachedCryptographyClientConfiguration]]
=== Cached Cryptography Client Configuration

Configures the cached cryptography client configuration.

The cryptography client is created based on a key. If the key does not change (no new versions are created), the client is cached and the *Encrypt Message* and *Decrypt Message* operations take less time.

When encrypting or decrypting a message, a key must be retrieved internally. Retrieving a key every time makes the operation take longer to execute. Enable *Cryptography Client Cache* to save time when retrieving the key.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Cached Crypto Client Ttl a| String | Cached crypto client time-to-live (TTL) value. | `10` |
| Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** RSA1_5 | Encryption algorithm type. |  |
| Key a| String | Key. |  |
|===

[[ExpirationPolicy]]
=== Expiration Policy

Configures an expiration policy strategy.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Idle Time a| Number | Configures the maximum amount of time that a dynamic configuration instance can remain idle before Mule considers it eligible for expiration. |  |
| Time Unit a| Enumeration, one of:

** NANOSECONDS
** MICROSECONDS
** MILLISECONDS
** SECONDS
** MINUTES
** HOURS
** DAYS | Time unit for the *Max Idle Time* field. |  |
|===

[[PoolingProfile]]
=== Pooling Profile

Configures the pooling profile type.

[%header,cols="20s,25a,30a,15a,10a"]
|===
| Field | Type | Description | Default Value | Required
| Max Active a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that can be borrowed from a session at one time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of components that are active at one time. When *Max Active* is exceeded, the pool is exhausted. |  |
| Max Idle a| Number | Controls the maximum number of Mule components that sit idle in the pool at any time. When set to a negative value, there is no limit to the number of Mule components that are idle at one time. |  |
| Max Wait a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds to wait for a pooled component to become available when the pool is exhausted and when *Exhausted Action* is set to `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT`. |  |
| Min Eviction Millis a| Number | Determines the minimum amount of time an object sits idle in the pool before the object is eligible for eviction. When non-positive, no objects are evicted from the pool due to idle time alone. |  |
| Eviction Check Interval Millis a| Number | Specifies the number of milliseconds between runs of the object evictor. When non-positive, no object evictor is executed. |  |
| Exhausted Action a| Enumeration, one of:

** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT
** WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL a| Specifies the behavior of the Mule component pool when the pool is exhausted:

* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_FAIL`
+
Throws a `NoSuchElementException`

* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_WAIT`
+
Blocks by invoking Object.wait(long) until a new or idle object is available

* `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW`
+
Creates a new Mule instance and returns it, essentially making *Max Active* meaningless. If *Max Wait* is positive, `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW` blocks for at most that many milliseconds, after which a `NoSuchElementException` is thrown. If *Max Wait* is negative, `WHEN_EXHAUSTED_GROW` blocks indefinitely. |  |
| Initialisation Policy a| Enumeration, one of:

** INITIALISE_NONE
** INITIALISE_ONE
** INITIALISE_ALL | Determines how components in a pool should be initialized:

* `INITIALISE_NONE`
+
Does not load any components into the pool on startup

* `INITIALISE_ONE`
+
Loads one initial component into the pool on startup

* `INITIALISE_ALL`
+
Loads all components in the pool on startup |  |
| Disabled a| Boolean | Specifies whether pooling is disabled or not. |  |
